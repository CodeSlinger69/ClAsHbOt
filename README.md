Please note: As of October 2016, this project is not actively being maintained.  I had held out hope that SuperCell would being something of interest to CoC during the October update, but unfortunately, it was not to be.  More building levels and more troop nerfs are not enough to keep me interested in this game.  Ever since the December 2015 update, SC appears to be killing this game, and really not paying attention to their customers any more.

Anyway.  If you still have an interest in CoC botting, I highly recommend mybot.run (http://mybot.run).  The developers of MBR have taken CoC botting in very new and interesting directions.  While the interface takes a bit to used to, it works great once you have it configured.  MBR will auto-play the whole game for you, upgrading troops, buildings, etc.  ClAsHbOt was always intended to be just a farm bot, and you can certainly use MBR in that same way.

Good luck, and happy botting!
